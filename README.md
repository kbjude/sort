The bobble sort is an algorithm that takes two elements, make a comparison between those two elements and if the first element is greater than the second one, it makes a swap, regardless a swap was made or not, the next iteration takes de second one as the first one in the previous iteration and now take another element like the second one and make again the comparison, this comparison continues until reaching the end of the array. The whole process is repeated over the array again from the beginning until an ordered array is formed
